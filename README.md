# ArchImage
Build AppImage packages for all distributions by including Arch Linux packages. Powered by JuNest.

# What is this?
ArchImage is the bundling of Arch Linux packages into an AppImage using [JuNest](https://github.com/fsquillace/junest).

This allows you to use the latest programs from Arch Linux and AUR on every distribution, old or newer.

# Usage
In this example I'm working for an AppImage of OBS Studio:

    mkdir tmp
    cd tmp
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivan-hc/ArchImage/main/apps/obs-junest.sh
    chmod a+x ./obs-junest.sh
    ./obs-junest.sh

Wait the time that the AppImage is ready before you test it wherever you want.
